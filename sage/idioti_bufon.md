            He had a large book which contained the list of the numerous races throughout the galaxies that had developed intelligence, and the much smaller book that listed those races that had reached maturity and had qualified for the Galactic Federation.
            In the first book, a number of those listed were crossed out; those that, for one reason or another, had failed.
            Misfortune, biochemical or biophysical shortcomings, social maladjustment took their toll.
            In the smaller book, however, no member listed had yet blanked out.

            Ah, yes,” said Naron. “I know the world.” And in flowing script he noted it in the first book and transferred its name into the second, using, as was customary, the name by which the planet was known to the largest fraction of its populace. He wrote: Earth.
