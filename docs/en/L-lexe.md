<big>Where Panlingue words come from?</big>

## Principles

Most Panlingue words are already international – at least in some part of the world!
The three key criteria for selecting words for Panlingue are:

- **Equality** : Words are be borrowed equally from different regions of the world.
  In practice it means that Panlingue borrows words from the languages of Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas.
- **Prevalence** : Widely spread words are favored.
  The more people know the word the better.
- **Simplicity** : Word forms with easy pronunciation are favored.

## Cultures of the world

Hartmut Traunmuller divided the world into four major cultural spheres in his article
[A Universal Interlanguage: Some Basic Considerations](http://www.ling.su.se/staff/hartmut/UIL.pdf).
The languages within a certain cultural sphere share words (loan words and translated loan words) and cultural concepts.
The four major cultural spheres are as follows.

1. The Euro-American cultural sphere
    - This sphere covers all of Europe, Americas, Australia and various smaller regions.
    - Languages of the West have been influenced greatly by Greek and Latin and in modern times by French and English.
2. The Afro-Asian (or the Islamic) cultural sphere
    - This group includes languages of areas where Islam is the main religion.
    - It spans from the Atlantic coast of Africa to the islands in the Pacific of Indonesia and the Philippines.
    - The languages of this cultural sphere are influenced by Persian and especially Arabic, which is the language of Quran, the holy book of Islam.
3. The South Asian (or the Indian) cultural sphere
    - This sphere covers the very populous subcontinent of India, Indochina and more
    - The classical language of this group are Sanskrit, Tamil and Pāli
    - The Indian vocabulary has been spread by Hinduism and especially Buddhism in all directions in Asia and elsewhere.
4. The East Asian (or the Chinese) cultural sphere
    - This culturel sphere grew around ancient China, the Middle Kingdom
    - All languages of East Asia are saturated by loan words from Chinese.
    - The biggest modern Chinese language, Mandarin, competes for the title of the most spoken language in the world today.

The cultural spheres are roughly outlined in the picture below.

## Selecting the source languages

It is estimated that over 6000 different languages are spoken in the world.
Some languages are spoken by many while others are spoken by only a few.
Native and non-native speakers of the five most widely spoken languages together
add up to more than half of the total population of the world.
It is impossible to include all languages into the construction of a world language because of their great number.
The number of source languages should be manageable for one person to work with.

So, which languages should be taken in?

[Power Language Index](http://www.kailchan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kai-Chan_Power-Language-Index-full-report_2016_v2.pdf)
(PLI) provides an answer to this question.
It is a tool for comparing efficacy of languages that has been created by Ph.D. Kai L. Chan.
It compares languages on how well they provide to a speaker the following five opportunities:

1. Geography: The ability to travel
2. Economy: The ability to participate in economic activities
3. Communication: The ability to participate in dialogue
4. Knowledge and media: The ability to consume knowledge and media
5. Diplomacy: The ability to engage in international relations

Chan builds a ranking of languages based on a combination of the above-listed opportunities.
This ranking is used as a reference in Panlingue.

### The main source languages for Panlingue

Most Panlingue words are borrowed from 21 widely spoken languages as listed in the table below.
The languages are selected so that they represent different language families,
different geographical regions and different cultures.

The following table is ordered by the rank in the Power Language Index.
The numbers of speakers are from the Power Language Index and the Wikipedia.

## Word selection method

There are a lot of international words, because languages influence each other all the time.
Some words are international in the West, some in the East, and some are even global.
Panlingue attempts to use as international, intercontinental and global words as much as possible.

Words that are specific to a certain culture shall be adopted from languages that best represent that culture.

Words for objects of nature (for example plants and animal species) shall be adopted from a language that is spoken in the area where that object is found.

So the first question is, does the word _belong_ to a certain region or culture?

Yes. → Select the word from languages that are important in that region or culture.  
No. → Use the following word selection method.

1. Collect translations for a given word in the 21 languages that were listed in the previous chapter
   by using electronic or printed or electronic dictionaries, Wiktionary, reliable machine translation, or some other tool.
2. Identify groups of similar words.
    - Similar words can be historically related
    - or they can sound alike by coincidence.
3. Select the most international group of similar words.
    - The more international, the better.
    - The best words are cross-cultural.
    - If there's no cross-cultural word, select the one that is known by the greatest number of 1st language speakers.
4. Select a word form that represents the group well and also fits well into Panlingue.
    - Strip off unnecessary prefixes and suffixes.
    - Use [the sounds, the spelling and the normal word structure](102_ABC.md) of Panlingue.
    - Make sure that the new word is not identical or too similar to any previously existing Panlingue word.

Normally a word appears in at least two of the source languages.
In case there isn't a common word, partially similar words can be selected.
Only in the last resort a word from only one language can be accepted.


## Word statistics

**Figure 3.** This network diagram shows how much Panlingue words the source languages have in common with each other.

Figure 3 is a network diagram of the 21 source languages of Panlingue.
The circles symbolize source languages.
The larger the diameter, the more words Panlingue has borrowed from that language.
Lines between the circles indicate how many Panlingue words the languages connected by the line have in common.
The thicker the line is, the more words the connected languages have in common with each other and Panlingue.


## Examples

### Selecting the word for 'language'

First possible candidates are searched from widely spoken languages.
The search reveals that there are several words that are international.

- Arabic لغة /luɣa/ is also known in Swahili _lugha_.
  It is also known in Persian and Turkic languages but with the meaning "dictionary".
- Persian زبان /zæba:n/ has been borrowed to Hindi.
- Latinate _lingua_ is found in the Romance languages and it has spread to most European languages
  in words like _linguistics_ and _multilingual_.
- Indo-Aryan भाषा /bʱaʂa/ is used in Hindi and Bangla and it has spread to several neighbouring languages
  including Tamil and Malay.

The most prevalent of these words is /bʱaʂa/.
It is recognised nearly everywhere in India, Indochina and Malay archipelago,
which are some of the most densely populated areas in the world.

| Language   | Spoken word  | Written word    |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Hindi      | bʱaʂa        | भाषा          |
| Punjabi    | bʱaʃa         | ਭਾਸ਼ਾ          |
| Gujarati   | bʱaʃa        | ભાષા          |
| Marathi    | bʱaɕa        | भाषा          |
| Bangla     | bʱaʃa        | ভাষা           |
| Telugu     | baʃa         | భాష          |
| Thai       | pʰa:sa:      | ภาษา         |
| Indonesian | bahasa       | bahasa          |
| Javanese   | basa         | basa            |
| Sundanese  | basa         | basa            |

As you can see, the same word is written and pronounced differently in different languages.
This is typical of international words.
They get adapted in almost every language to their own spelling system.
Likewise it is necessary to adapt this word to the spelling and pronunciation rules of Panlingue.
So the Panlingue word for language becomes
**bashe**.
