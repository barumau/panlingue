# The basic rules of Panlingue

These are the basic rules of Panlingue language.
They are described in more detail later in this document.

1.  The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.
2.  The stress falls on the syllable that is before the last consonant of the word
    unless otherwise indicated.
3.  Nouns don't have a mandatory ending,
    but they usually end in **-e**, **-ia** or a consonant.
    They have a single, unchanging form
    that is not affected by number, gender or case.
4.  Adjectives end in **-i**
    and they may become before or after the word that they modify.

    **rapidi loge**  
    'fast speech'
5.  Adverbs end in **-o**.
    They modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs and complete sentences.
    They come before the word that they modify or very last in the sentence.

    **vero rapidi loge**  
    'very fast speech'

    **te rapido loga.**  
    'You talk fast.'
6.  The verb ending **-a** indicates that
    the agent of the action is immediately before the verb.

    **me yama aple.**  
    'I eat apples.'
7.  The verb ending -u indicates that
    the patient of the action is immediately before the verb.
    **aple yamu.**  
    'Apples are eaten.'
8.  In the _pivot structure_, the object of the transitive verb
    functions as the subject of the next verb.

    **me pleza te dona pese.**  
    'I ask you to give money.'
9.  Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.

    **me suala te basha panlingue?** → **suala te basha panlingue?**  
    'Do you speak Panlingue?'

    **me pleza te loga klaro.** →  **pleza loga klaro.**  
    'Please speak clearly.'
10. Compound words are created by putting the word stems side by side.
    The linking vowel **-o-** is inserted between the stems.

    **hur-** ('freedom') + **ist-** ('proponent') → **huriste** ('liberalist')

    **post-** ('mail') + **sinduk-** ('box') → **postosinduke** ('mailbox')
