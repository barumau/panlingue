# Esperanto vs. Panlingue

Esperanto has been the most popular constructed auxiliary language for over a century since the 1890s.
That's why all new auxiliary languages are rightfully compared to it.


Esperanto has been criticized over the years.
Many of the recurring points of critique are included in Justin B. Rye's article
[Learn Not to Speak Esperanto](http://jbr.me.uk/ranto/index.html).
It has been replied in detail by [Vítor De Araújo](https://elmord.org/misc/kontrauranto/)
and more broadly by [Claude Piron](http://claudepiron.free.fr/articlesenanglais/why.htm) among many others.

Despite all the critique, Esperanto has its merits and its relative success among auxiliary languages is undeniable.
But does it really deserve its success?
Is Esperanto really an ideal world language?
In this article we will review the most important points of critique and compare Esperanto to Panlingue.


## Alphabet

The alphabet of Esperanto is as follows:

    A B C Ĉ D E F G Ĝ H Ĥ I J Ĵ K L M N O P R S Ŝ T U Ŭ V Z
    a b c ĉ d e f g ĝ h ĥ i j ĵ k l m n o p r s ŝ t u ŭ v z

People often criticize the letters with "hats"
because they are not included in the standard keyboards of typewriters, computers and smart devices.
The letters with hats really are a problem that could have been avoided.

What is often overlooked is that there are two sets of letters:
big letters and small letters. Both do the same basic task: they represent spoken language in writing.
It is like using two different hammers to hit one nail.
Most writing systems in the world get by with only one type of letters.
For example the writing systems of Arabia, India, China, Korea, Japan and Ethiopia don't differentiate large and small letters.

The alphabet of Panlingue uses logically only the small Basic Latin letters.

## Pronunciation

The sounds in Esperanto and the rules that govern how they go together are primarily based on Polish,
with additional influence from other European languages like English and German,
with little regard for how easy they are to pronounce internationally.
This gives rise to consonant clusters that are difficult to pronounce for most people,
especially at the beginning of words, such as *kn* as in *knabo*,
*kv* as in *kvar*, *mn* as in *mnemonika*, *ŝr* as in *ŝranko*, and *sc* as in *scii* /stsi.i/.

Panlingue's word structure is designed to balance keeping international words recognizable
and to make them easy to pronounce for as many people as possible.
Thus, the only consonant cluster permitted at the beginning of a word is a stop or fricative plus a liquid,
such as *kr* as in *kristal*.


## Eurocentrism

### Eurocentric grammar

Esperanto and most other Western auxiliary languages are pretty much the same.
They have largely the same Western European vocabulary (with minor differences)
and they repeat the same [Standard Average European](http://www.joerg-rhiemeier.de/Conlang/sae.html) features of grammar,
that are shared by French, English, German, Spanish and other languages from West and Central Europe.

1. Word class is defined by suffixes.
   Verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs have their specific endings.
2. Nouns (or at least pronouns) are inflected for cases such as nominative, dative and accusative.
3. Verbs are inflected for tense, person and/or number.
4. There are definite and/or indefinite articles.
5. Singular and plural forms are separate.
   The plural form is used redundantly also after numerals.
   For example in English *one cat*, *two cats* and in Esperanto *unu kato*, *du katoj*.
6. Prepositions are used instead of postpositions.
7. There is a specific polite form for 2nd person singular pronoun.
8. There are separate gender-specific 3rd person singular pronouns.
9. The perfect tense is made up of *to have* or *to be* and a participle.
   For example in English *I have talked* and in Esperanto *mi estas parolinta*.
10. The passive is made up of *to be* and a participle.
    For example in English *I am seen* and in Esperanto *mi estas vidita*.
11. The normal word order is subject–verb–object.
12. The word order is changed in questions.

Both English and Esperanto have all of the above except number 7.
Ido, Novial and Interlingua have all of them.
In contrast for example Chinese has only features 8 and 11,
and the former is apparent only in the written language – because of Western influence!
(In Chinese there are three characters for the 3rd person singular 他 ('he'), 她 ('she') and 它 ('it')
but all of them are pronounced the same, *tā*.)

Standard Average European features are not bad just because they imply Western bias.
Some (not all) of them are bad because they are illogical or simply difficult for those who are not used to them in their native language.
Many learners stumble with articles and "difficult" personal pronouns.
The world language should be free of such unnecessary features and rules.

Panlingue has only features 1 and 11.
These are also main features of Esperanto.
But otherwise Panlingue diverges greatly from Esperanto in particular and from Standard Average European grammar in general.
So grammar-wise Panlingue is not Eurocentric, unlike Esperanto.


### Western or global vocabulary?

Esperanto boasts with its international vocabulary.
At a closer look it's not so international.
Most Esperanto words come from Western languages.
Esperanto chooses a European word even when no international Western word can be found.
Such words are *birdo* ('bird', similar only in English),
*vosto* ('tail', from Russian *хвост*) and *knabo* ('boy', from German *Knabe*).

Isn't it narrow-minded to create a language for the world without looking beyond your own neighbourhood?
It was in the spirit of the time, the time of colonialism, when Esperanto was created.

Panlingue acknowledges that there are many stocks of international words:
Western, Indian, Sinitic and Perso-Arabic being the major ones.
Hundreds of words are borrowed from each of them.
Panlingue's vocabulary is evenly global.


## Word class marking

Simple word class marking with final vowels is an ingenious idea and it fits well with the Indo-European root-and-suffix word pattern.
But the way different word classes relate to each other can be confusing if not handled carefully.


### Esperanto roots have inherent word classes

One of the most confusing things in Esperanto is that,
while it has distinct word class markers,
all roots belong to word classes already by default.
What's even more confusing is that roots,
which seemingly belong to the same class,
can have a different underlying word class.

For example, the adjectives *blua*, *brula*, *ferma* and *naska* seem similar on the surface,
but in reality they have different inherent word classes.
Fundamentally *blu-* is an adjective,
*brul-* is an intransitive verb
*ferm-* is a transitive verb,
and *nask-* is an action noun.
As a result, deriving other words from them is different.
Therefore their direct derivatives are distributed asymmetrically.
In the table below, direct derivates are in bold cursive
and indirect derivatives, which include additional derivative suffixes, are in normal cursive.

| Word type             | *blu-*         | *brul-*        | *ferm-*        | *nask-*        |
|:----------------------|:---------------|:---------------|:---------------|:---------------|
| Noun                  | ***blu-o***    | ***brul-o***   | ***ferm-o***   | ***nask-o***   |
|                       | 'color blue'   | 'burning'      | 'closure'      | 'birth'        |
| Adjective of relation | -              | -              |  -             | ***nask-a***   |
|                       |                |                |                | 'natal'        |
| Adjective of being    | ***blu-a***    | ***brul-a***   | ***ferm-a***   | *nask-it-a*    |
|                       | 'blue'         | 'burning'      | 'closed'       | 'born'         |
| Verb of being         | ***blu-i***    | -              | -              | -              |
|                       | 'be blue'      |                |                |                |
| Verb of becoming      | *blu-iĝ-i*     | ***brul-i***   | *ferm-iĝ-i*    | *nask-iĝ-i*    |
|                       | 'get blue'     | 'burn'         | 'be closed'    | 'be born'      |
| Verb of doing         | *blu-ig-i*     | *brul-ig-i*    | ***ferm-i***   | ***nask-i***   |
|                       | 'make blue'    | 'make burn'    | 'close'        | 'give birth'   |


### Panlingue roots are classless

The roots are classless in Panlingue.
There's no need to memorize for example *kluz-* whether is fundamentally a verb or an adjective.
It is neither!
Word class is only indicated by adding the appropriate ending:
*-i* for adjectives or stative verbs,
*-a* for agent-oriented verbs and
*-u* for patient-oriented verbs.

| Word type             | *nil-*         | *pir-*         | *kluz-*        | *nat-*         |
|:----------------------|:---------------|:---------------|:---------------|:---------------|
| Noun                  | ***nil-e***    | ***pir-e***    | ***kluz-e***   | ***nat-e***    |
|                       | 'color blue'   | 'burning'      | 'closure'      | 'birth'        |
| Adj. or verb of being | ***nil-i***    | ***pir-i***    | ***kluz-i***   | ***nat-i***    |
|                       | 'blue'         | 'burning'      | 'closed'       | 'born'         |
| Verb of becoming      | ***nil-u***    | ***pir-u***    | ***kluz-u***   | ***nat-u***    |
|                       | 'get blue'     | 'burn'         | 'be closed'    | 'be born'      |
| Verb of doing         | ***nil-a***    | ***pir-a***    | ***kluz-a***   | ***nat-a***    |
|                       | 'make blue'    | 'make burn'    | 'close'        | 'give birth'   |
