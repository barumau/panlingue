Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

## General

#### How many people can speak Panlingue?

Currently speakers of Panlingue are counted in tens. It is still a
very new language.

#### How can I help to spread Panlingue?

Learn Panlingue! Speak it with others! Talk about it with others!
Write stories or articles, make videos, podcasts, music, etc.

You can also help with this website by translating content and
correcting mistakes. Contents ("source code") of this website are
stored in [GitHub](https://github.com/barumau/panlingue). You can also
send your edited files by email to risto@panlingue.info

#### When was Panlingue created?

Creators of Panlingue began to create a language together first in 2005.
Since the beginning the basic idea was to create an evenly global
auxiliary language. Many different structures and ideas were tried
over the years. The name _Panlingue_ was invented already in 2007 but
the language got its "final" form in 2017 – but of course languages
evolve all the time!

#### What does the flag of Panlingue represent?

![](http://www.panlingue.info/bandir/bandir.png "The flag of Panlingue")

The flag of Panlingue represents global equality. There is a symbol of
_the blue planet_ against the background of the dark blue space. The
equality sign is laid over the Earth.

#### Why the mascot of Panlingue is a duck-billed platypus?

Platypus (**batokrote** in Panlingue) is an egg-laying, duck-billed,
beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal that lives in eastern Australia.
It is an unusual creature. That's why the platypus is a fitting
mascot for Panlingue, which is also an unusual mix, a mix of words and
grammar from East and West, from North and South.

Panlingue doesn't fit into any of the traditional types of languages.
Also in that regard it is similar to the platypus, which is of its own type.

## Past, present and future

#### I want to change something in Panlingue. What should I do?

If your change is a small thing, you should try it in practice with
other people and see how it works. If it really is a good change,
other people will accept it and use it.

Creating offshoot languages is very common in the auxiliary language
community. The case of Esperanto is famous. Offshoots of Esperanto
are counted in the hundreds but most people haven't even heard of
them. Esperanto is still the most popular language of its kind.

It is better to have one big language with several dialects than
many competing languages.

#### Which languages have influenced the grammar of Panlingue?

Panlingue has been influenced by both natural and constructed
languages.

- Natural languages with isolating grammar were a useful model. For
  example the pivot structure comes directly from Chinese.
- Works of earlier language makers were inspirational.
    - Esperanto, Ido, Novial etc. were closely examined.
    - Latino sine Flexione, Lingua Sistemfrater and Interglossa all
      have well thought-out isolating grammars.
- Natural contact languages gave many ideas. It is an interesting
  observation that when speakers of different languages come into
  contact, they tend to create extremely simplified grammar to
  overcome the language barrier — no matter how complex languages
  they speak natively.


#### Who made Panlingue?

The starter of Panlingue is _Risto Kupsala_ (born in Finland in 1979).
He is a language hobbyist and an engineer in information technology
who wants to help the world communicate better.
People from many countries have helped over the years.
There is a list of some of the contributors in
[GitHub](https://github.com/barumau/panlingue/graphs/contributors).



## Auxiliary language

#### What is a worldlang?

A worldlang is a constructed interlanguage that borrows its words,
speech sounds and possibly grammar from different language families
of the world. There are many worldlangs. Some of them are listed
[here](http://www.kupsala.net/risto/tekokieli/worldlangs.html).

#### How does Panlingue differ from other auxiliary languages?

- The vocabulary of Panlingue is evenly global. It consists of Western
  (Greco-Latin) words, Perso-Arabic words, Chinese words and Indian
  words. Many other auxiliary languages use only or mostly Western
  words, which is not ideal for the world language in our opinion.
- Internationality is the main criterion for selecting words to
  Panlingue. All the words of Panlingue are known by many nations in
  some part of the world.
- The grammar of Panlingue is concise but very flexible. Panlingue has
  only a few grammatical structures, which are re-used over and over
  again.
- Panlingue is a truly neutral language. It's not meant to imitate any
  languages, whereas for example Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua are
  intentionally similar to the European languages.

#### Did Esperanto contribute to the birth of Panlingue?

At first Esperanto was an important source of inspiration. However
the influence of Esperanto to the final language is insignificant.
Panlingue has very different structure and vocabulary compared to
Esperanto.

#### Are the makers of Panlingue aware of the history of the IAL movement?

Yes. Here are some of the most important lessons to be learned from
the history of the international auxiliary language (IAL) movement.

- Over 99% of IALs do not survive in the long term.
- Languages that are created without any pre-existing model (so
  called _a priori_ languages) have very low chance of survival.
- Languages that imitate and simplify one or more natural languages
  have some chance of survival.
- Out of a group of many similar languages only one is likely to do
  well.
- Success can be short-lived. (Remember Volapük and Ido.)
- Rational reasons do not explain success. The "best" language
  doesn't necessarily win.
- Large international organizations, such as the UN or the EU, pay
  very little attention to IALs. So it is up to grassroots movements
  to push an IAL to success.


#### Should Panlingue replace English?

Panlingue is not meant to replace English or any other languages.
People have ability to speak several languages and they speak every
language for a different reason. Some people speak one language at
home, another at work and yet another on international travels. We
can imagine a world where English and all other languages will
continue to be spoken, and where Panlingue is spoken as the universal
second language.

In a way, English will never be replaced. Those who speak it today
will speak it tomorrow. But new generations will grow and they will
choose which language(s) they want to speak with each other. So it
will be _another world_ with another world language. Maybe it will be
English, or maybe a new kind of English or maybe something else. The
landscape of languages changes in a natural process. Different
languages were spoken in the past and different languages will be
spoken in the future.

You are free to speak Panlingue, English and any other language that
your heart desires.



## Letters and sounds

#### Why is the letter X pronounced like SH?
 
Panlingue follows the phonetic principle. One letter represents
exactly one sound, and one sound is written with exactly one letter.

Traditionally there isn't any dedicated letter for /ʃ/ in the Latin
alphabet. This sound is frequently written by the letter combination
SH in English. Other languages use different letters and letter
combinations such as CH in French, SCH in German, SJ in Swedish, SZ
in Polish, Š in Czech and Ş in Turkish.

However, there is a handful of languages that use the letter X for
/ʃ/. Basque and Maltese do it without exception. Portuguese and
Catalan are less consistent, but X stands for /ʃ/ frequently.
Panlingue word **xampu'** is written almost exactly the same as in Portuguese.
It means _shampoo_.

In the Chinese romanization systen, Pīnyīn, the letter X stands for
/ɕ/ which is close to /ʃ/. Panlingue has many words with X from
Chinese, for example **xim, xin** and **xuxe**.

![](http://www.panlingue.info/grafe/X.png "C = ʃ")


#### Why is the letter C pronounced like CH?

Actually there are several languages where C is pronounced like English CH,
including Indonesian, Hausa, Oromo and Rwanda.
In Italian, when C is followed by E or I, it is pronounced /tʃ/.
This pronunciation is present in English loan words from Italian such as _cello_ and _cappuccino_.

![](http://www.panlingue.info/grafe/C.png "C = ts o tʃ")

On the other hand, the letter C doesn't stand for any dedicated sound in English.
The _hard C_ can be replaced by K and the _soft C_ by S.
So it makes sense to use C instead of CH.

#### Is Panlingue's alphabet unique?

It is unique but not as odd as you might think. In fact,
the majority of letters (19 in total) are pronounced in general in
the way in Panlingue and English, 5 are different, and one (q)
is missing from Panlingue.

Most letters correspond to approximately similar sounds in Panlingue
and in other languages that use the Latin alphabet in their spelling
or their standard way of Romanization.
 
The alphabet of Panlingue is compared to alphabets and Romanizations
used in other languages in the table below.

- Letters that correspond normally to approximately similar sounds
  in Panlingue and in the compared language are listed under SIMILAR.
  For example English g is considered similar to Panlingue g although
  there is the 'soft' g (as in _gel_) besides the more common 'hard'
  g (as in _get_) in English.
- Letters that Panlingue has but the compared language doesn't have
  are listed under MISSING.
- Letters that correspond usually to different sounds in Panlingue
  and in the compared language are listed under DIFFERENT.

## Grammar

#### Is Panlingue a pidgin or a creole?

Pidgins and creoles are _natural_ contact languages.
Panlingue is a _constructed_ contact language.
So the answer is no, Panlingue is not a real pidgin or a creole.
However, it is characterized by many of the same features as pidgins and creoles.

The following is a list of characteristic features of pidgins and creoles
that apply for Panlingue too.

1. Lack of grammatical complexity
   - No definite or indefinite article
   - Omission of the copula 'be'
   - Tense, aspect, modality and negation are not part of the verb.
   - Passive structures are not used.
2. Lack of morphological complexity
   - Nouns and pronouns are not inflected
   - Verbs are not inflected and tense is marked by separate words
3. Semantic transparency
   - Meaning of a word can be determined from the meanings of the parts of which the word is built.
4. Reduced vocabulary
   - Multifunctional words
   - All-purpose prepositions
5. Simple phonology
   - Avoid difficult sounds.
   - Use mostly simple syllable structures.
   - Prefer short words.
   - Tone is not used to distinguish words.

#### How word forms change in Panlingue?

In general, word forms can change in four ways.

1. Total change: go ⇒ went
2. Change in the stem: write ⇒ wrote
3. Change of an affix: electric ⇒ electron
4. Addition of an affix: man ⇒ manhood

In Panlingue, only 3. and 4. are used.
We can change the ending of a word,
so for example **loge** (_speech_) can be changed to **loga** (_to speak_).
We can also add suffixes,
so for example **insania** (_humanity_) can be created from **insan** (_human being_).

#### Why word forms change in Panlingue?

Panlingue uses different word forms to indicate different word classes.
There are many good sides:

- Learning the grammar is very easy because
  the essentials of the grammar are encoded visibly and audibly in words.
- You can understand the structure of a sentence without knowing the meaning of all words.
- You don't have to memorize the word class with each word separately
  – words include that information in the last vowel!
- Word derivation is symmetric because word stems are neutral in Panlingue.
   - A word stem becomes a verb, a noun or a modifier only when the corresponding vowel ending is added.
   - Even transitive and intransitive verbs are symmetric in Panlingue,
     so we always know is the subject the agent or the recipient of the action.

Word class marking is a very efficient method to realize a functional grammar.
It is done in Panlingue with a minimal set of only four endings.
(In comparison, Esperanto employs 10 basic and 7 combined endings.)

#### Why agglutinating structure was chosen for Panlingue?

Different structures were considered and tested during the
development of Panlingue. The main choice was between an agglutinating
and an isolating structure.

1. In an agglutinating language every word can be clearly divided
   into component parts. For example Esperanto word "niaj" (our) is
   made out of three parts: ni- (we), -a- (adjective marker) and -j
   (plural marker).
2. In an isolating language every word consists of just one part. For
   example in Mandarin Chinese the word for "our" consists of three
   separate words: wǒ (first person pronoun), men (plural marker) and
   de (possessive marker). Then they are simply put together:
   wǒmende, 我们的.

Panlingue is a lightly agglutinating language. It uses separate words
to express things like person, number, mood, tense and aspect, which
are typically expressed with inflection in agglutinating and
inflecting languages.

To demonstrate the difference, let's compare the same sentence in
Esperanto (a heavily agglutinating language) and Panlingue. Parts of
word are separated with the vertical bar sign.

    Esperanto: Mi vol|as  vid|i  vi|a|j|n  du  bel|a|j|n  okul|o|j|n  nun.
    Panlingue:  me vol|a   vid|a  t|i       dul|i sundar|i kan|e       zay|o.
               I  want to see    your      two beautiful  eyes        now.

#### Are the word class markers unnatural?

Panlingue uses final vowels as word class markers.
It is not an unnatural thing to do
because there are comparable morphemes in natural languages
that are used for marking various word classes and their subclasses.

For example, the Bantu languages use a system of prefixes for marking nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs.
Here are some Swahili words together with the same words in Panlingue.

| Panlingue | Swahili | English meaning |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| kitab-   | -and- | the root related to writing |
| kitaba   | ku-and-ik-a | to write |
| kitabu   | ku-and-ik-w-a | to be written |
| kitabe   | ma-and-ish-i | writing, text |
| kitabi   | -a ma-and-ish-i | written, textual |

Another example, Arabic uses a system of vowel infixes to convert consonant roots into different word classes and their subclasses.
Here are some Arabic words together with the same words in Panlingue.

| Panlingue | Arabic | English meaning |
|----------|---------|-----------------|| kitab- | k-t-b | the root related to writing | 
| kitaba   | kataba | to write |
| kitabu   | kutiba | to be written |
| kitabe   | kitāb | writing, text, book |
| kitabi   | kitābi | written, textual |

Panlingue's system is a very simple one – it includes only the bare minimum! – but otherwise it's nothing new.
Various natural languages have comparable morphemes for marking words in different word classes.
The morpheme type doesn't matter: prefixes, infixes, circumfixes and suffixes can do the same task.
Single-vowel suffixes are the most minimal and therefore the simplest type!

Looking at the examples above, it's obvious that the system of Panlingue is simpler than those of Swahili and Arabic.
English is the least systematic as it uses sometimes independent words (to, to be) and sometimes suffixes (-en, -ing, -al) as markers.

In conclusion, using the vowel suffixes for word class markers is unnatural only for its simplicity, nothing else.


## Vocabulary

#### Where Panlingue's words come from?

Panlingue's words come from all parts of the world.

In our opinion the world language should be a mix of all languages
in the world. That's why Panlingue has at least a few words in common
with almost all languages of the world.

A lot of words are in common to international and important regional languages.

Figure. Pie chart showing distribution of influence from the main source languages to Panlingue.


#### Why Panlingue borrows words mainly from widely spoken languages?

About 6500 languages are spoken in the world today. It would be
possible to borrow one and _only one_ word from every language.
But it wouldn't be very useful, if you knew only one or two words in
the world language beforehand, would it?

It's smarter to borrow words that are in common to many languages.
Then most people will know many words in Panlingue.

There are common words in every region of the world. For example,
in Europe there are European international words, which often come
from important ancient languages like Latin and Greek.
In the Indian peninsula there are ancient words from Sanskrit that
are in common to every language of that region.

That's why it is enough that we select some languages from every
part of the world. They represent also the other languages of that
region.

#### Why the last vowel of words is sometimes different in Panlingue than in language X?

In Panlingue, words consist of a stem and one or more suffixes.
A suffix is a part of word that belongs to the end.
The final vowel of a word has a grammatical meaning in Panlingue.
That's the basic reason why the final vowels are sometimes different in Panlingue than in other languages.

The second reason is that Panlingue borrows words from many languages,
and often those languages don't agree about the final vowel.
For example the word **supe** (_soup_) ends in -a in Spanish _sopa_,
in -u in Japanese スープ or _sūpu_,
in -e in German _Suppe_,
and not in any vowel in English _soup_.
So it's not one and the same word but rather an international family of similar words,
and Panlingue's **supe** fits perfectly into that family.

The third reason is that endings of words change already in many source languages.
For example, Panlingue word **novi** is borrowed, among others, from Portuguese.
In Portuguese, this word has many forms and only the stem nov- remains the same:
_nov|o, nov|a, nov|os, nov|as, nov|idade, re|nov|ar_...
So it makes sense to take only the stem and attach our regular Panlingue suffixes to it.

#### Shouldn't "salam" mean "peace"?

In many languages, expressions of greeting have something to do with
peace, health or well-being. The origins of Panlingue's word **salam**
can be traced back to Semitic triliteral root SLM, which covers a
variety of meanings including safety, security, peace and health.
Likewise the English word _salutation_ (and French greeting _salut_)
can be traced back to Latin "salus", which means safety, security,
health and well-being.

So the meaning of **salam** is greater than the meaning of peace. It
means well-being in general and you can use it as a general
expression for well-wishing in all kinds of situations, not just when
you meet somebody. See the first lesson in the [phrasebook](fraze.md)
for a lot of examples!
