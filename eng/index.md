## What is Panlingue?

Panlingue is a helping language for world-wide use.
It is an easy language that people can use to talk with each other
when they don't talk any other common language.
It is meant to supplement other languages in our multilingual world.

Panlingue is a constructed language.
It is simpler, more regular and easier to learn than natural world languages,
like English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Arabic and Hindi.
Learning Panlingue is equally easy for everybody.
Its words have been borrowed from many languages on all continents and all cultures of the world.
