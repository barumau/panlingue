# Panlingue

Panlingue is a globally sourced constructed language
that combines different types of grammar and international words from all continents into one language.
It can be used for many purposes.
The list below suggests some possible use cases for the language.

- learning phonetics (IPA)
- learning grammar
- learning international and intercultural words
- learning systematic word derivation
- understanding different word orders
- interlanguage for human translation and machine translation
- interlanguage for human communication (international auxiliary language)

Panlingue is a perfect language to be learned as the first foreign language,
because it prepares students to study other foreign languages in a unique way.
Panlingue helps students to understand and use

- the basic word classes
- different word orders
- analytic and synthetic syntaxes
- word derivation and structure of international words
- international words from European, American, Asian and African cultures.

One year of learning Panlingue produces a language ability equivalent to what the average learner reaches with other languages after several years of study.
It is a first stepping stone that builds confidence and improves the ability of the student to learn any other language in the future.

One year of learning Panlingue also enables students to communicate well with a growing number of people
who have also learned this regular, flexible and multicultural language.
