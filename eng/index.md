# Panlingue

Panlingue is a globally sourced constructed language
that combines different types of grammar and international words from all continents into one language.
It can be used for many purposes.
The list below suggests some possible use cases for the language.

- learning phonetics (IPA)
- learning grammar
- learning international and intercultural words
- learning systematic word derivation
- understanding different word orders
- interlanguage for human translation and machine translation
- interlanguage for human communication (international auxiliary language)

Panlingue is a perfect language to be learned as the first foreign language,
because it prepares students to study other foreign languages in a unique way.
Panlingue helps students to understand and use

- the basic word classes
- different word orders
- analytic and synthetic syntaxes
- word derivation and structure of international words
- international words from European, American, Asian and African cultures.

One year of learning Panlingue produces a language ability equivalent to what the average learner reaches with other languages after several years of study.
It is a first stepping stone that builds confidence and improves the ability of the student to learn any other language in the future.

One year of learning Panlingue also enables students to communicate well with a growing number of people
who have also learned this regular, flexible and multicultural language.

## Overview of Panlingue's structure

Panlingue is written in the Latin (and English!) alphabet:  
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V X Y Z

All letters are pronounced roughly in the same way as in English.

All vowels are pure vowels.
They are pronounced as in
<i><u>a</u>re th<u>e</u>re thr<u>ee</u> <u>o</u>r tw<u>o</u></i>.

The spelling of Panlingue is nearly phonetic.
One sound = one letter or a pair of letters.

The stress is on that syllable that is before the last consonant of the root word.
Prefixes and suffixes are either unstressed or they may carry a secondary stress.  
*múlti hóm póta básha pandúnia.*
– Many people can speak Panlingue.

Words stay always the same in Panlingue.
There aren't any special _inflected_ forms for cases, tenses, moods, singular and plural etc.

The normal word order is subject–verb–object
so the doer comes first, then the action word and finally the object of the action.  
*me ama tu.*
– I love you.
