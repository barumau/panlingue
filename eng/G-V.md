# 9. Verbs

A verb denotes an action or an occurence, for example *to eat*, *to speak*, *to look* and *to think*.

### Agent and patient roles

A verb can involve an agent (abbreviated *A*) and a patient (abbreviated *P*).
The agent is the active participant,
which brings about an event and has control over it.
The patient is the passive participant,
which is affected by the event.

Agent and patient can mean many things,
but prototypical agents and patients share certain characteristics.

The prototypical agent

1. is alive
2. can move
3. participates in the event by its own will
4. causes a change in another participant
5. exists independently of the event.

Consider the sentence *a player kicked the ball to the goal*.
The *player* is the agent because he is alive, moves, kicks the ball by its own will and causes a change of place in the ball.

The prototypical patient

1. might be a non-living thing
2. is standing still in relation to another participant
3. is drawn into the event by another participant
4. undergoes a change because of the event
5. might not exist without the event.

Consider again the sentence *the player kicked the ball to the goal*.
The ball is the patient, because it's a non-living thing, it stood still in relation to the player, it is drawn to the event by the player and it undergoes a change of place.

     The player  kicked  the ball.

        AGENT     VERB    PATIENT

Consider another sentence, *the player scored a point*.
Here the *point* is the patient, because it would not exist without the event.
In fact, it undergoes a change of state from non-existence into existence.

     The player  scored  a point.

## Verb types

There are two types of verbs in Panlingue.
Their difference is that they indicate opposite orders of agent and patient.

1. Forward verbs end in *-a*,
   and they are immediately preceded by the agent and immediately followed by the patient.
2. Backward verbs end in *-u*,
   and they are immediately preceded by the patient and immediately followed by the agent.

Note that the verb types deal only with the word order.
They don't have anything to do with passivity or transitivity,
which are manifested on the clause-level.

### Forward verbs (A-verbs)

Verbs that end in *-a* are called _forward verbs_
because the energy that originates from the agent flows forward via the verb tow the patient.

    AGENT ───> A-VERB ───> PATIENT

The verb is the only necessary member of a clause.
A minimal phrase can consist of a verb only,
as in phrase B below.

A: **te loga o auda?**
– Do you you talk or listen?  
B: **auda.**
– (I) listen.

Sometimes a verb is accompanied by only one participant,
either agent or patient.
If there is a word immediately before the A-verb, it is the agent.

    ┌─────────┐ ╔══════════╗
    │  AGENT  │→║  A-VERB  ║
    └─────────┘ ╚══════════╝

*`me loga.`*  
 `A    V`  
'I speak.'

If there is a word immediately after the A-verb, it is the patient.

    ╔══════════╗ ┌─────────┐
    ║  A-VERB  ║→│ PATIENT │
    ╚══════════╝ └─────────┘

*`vida ye!`*  
 ` V   P`  
'Watch this!'

There are three possible word orders when both agent and patient are present:
agent–verb–patient (AVP),
patient–agent–verb (PAV),
and verb–patient–agent (VPA).

The most common word order is agent–verb–patient (AVP).
This is the direct word order
that is normally used.

         ┌─────────┐ ╔══════════╗ ┌─────────┐
    AVP: │  AGENT  │→║  A-VERB  ║→│ PATIENT │
         └─────────┘ ╚══════════╝ └─────────┘

*me vida les.*
– I see them.  
*te beka ban.*
– You bake bread.

The second order is patient–agent–verb (PAV).

          ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ╔══════════╗
    PAV:  │ PATIENT │ │  AGENT  │→║  A-VERB  ║
          └─────────┘ └─────────┘ ╚══════════╝
                ↑                       │
                └───────────────────────┘

It is used when the speaker wants to draw the focus on the patient.
It is used for fronting the question word.
It is also common in dependent clauses.

Examples:  
*ke te vida?*
– What do you see?  
*me yama ban,* ***de*** *te beka.*
– I eat bread **that** you baked.


The third possible order is the verb–patient–agent order (VPA), which is rarely used.

         ╔══════════╗ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐
    VPA: ║  A-VERB  ║→│ PATIENT │ │  AGENT  │
         ╚══════════╝ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
             ↑                        │
             └────────────────────────┘

This order can be use used when the speaker wants to add the agent as an afterthought or clarification.

*vida te, li feme.*
– Sees you, that woman.


### Backward verbs (U-verbs)

Verbs that end in *-u* are called _backward verbs_,
because the energy flows backward to the patient via the verb from the agent.

    PATIENT <─── U-VERB ───> AGENT

The arguments of backward verbs are exactly in the opposite order compared to forward verbs.

Sometimes a verb is accompanied by only one participant,
either agent or patient.
If there is a word immediately before the U-verb, it is the patient.

    ┌─────────┐ ╔══════════╗
    │ PATIENT │←║  A-VERB  ║
    └─────────┘ ╚══════════╝

*`nave mergu.`*  
 ` P     V`  
'Ship sank.'

If there is a word immediately after the U-verb, it is the agent.

    ╔══════════╗ ┌─────────┐
    ║  A-VERB  ║←│  AGENT  │
    ╚══════════╝ └─────────┘

*`venu man.`*  
 ` V   A`  
'Came a man.'

There are three possible word orders for U-verbs when both agent and patient are present:
patient–verb–agent (PVA),
agent–patient–verb (APV),
and verb–agent–patient (VAP).

The patient-verb-agent order is common in the passive voice,
where the focus is on the passive recipient of the action.

         ┌─────────┐ ╔══════════╗ ┌─────────┐
    PVA: │ PATIENT │←║  U-VERB  ║←│  AGENT  │
         └─────────┘ ╚══════════╝ └─────────┘

This order is usually translated to English by using the passive voice or an intransitive verb,
but sometimes a transitive verb can be used too.

Examples:  
*ban beku te.*
– Bread is baked by you.  
*kupe parcu.*
– The cup broke ~ got broken.  
*rajer suku les.*
– The king is pleased by them. ~ The king likes them.

The most common order is agent–patient–verb (APV).
It is used typically in the active voice, where the the focus is on the agent of the action.

The APV order is equivalent to the subject–object–verb word order (SOV)
that is the most common word order by number of languages.
It is the normal word order in languages like Latin, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, Hindi and Tamil.
SOV is followed by SVO (i.e. AVP) as the second-most common order.
Together they account for almost 90% of the world's languages.

         ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ╔══════════╗
    APV: │  AGENT  │ │ PATIENT │←║  U-VERB  ║
         └─────────┘ └─────────┘ ╚══════════╝
             │                        ↑
             └────────────────────────┘

Examples:  
*me les vidu.*
– _I them see._  
*te ban beku.*
– _You bread bake._

The verb–agent–patient order is very rare but possible.
This order is similar to the VSO word order of Classical Arabic and Filipino.

         ╔══════════╗ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐
    VAP: ║  U-VERB  ║←│  AGENT  │ │ PATIENT │
         ╚══════════╝ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
             │                        ↑
             └────────────────────────┘

*vidu me te.*
– 'I see you.'


### Stative verbs

In Panlingue, also adjectives can be used as verbs.
When adjectives are usd in that role, they are called **adjectival verbs** or **stative verbs**.
They are basically adjectives that describe the subject in a verb-like manner.
The subject of a stative verb is in the state denoted by the verb root.
Stative verbs are frequently accompanied by the verb
*sa*
'to be'.
When it is optional, it is marked inside brackets in the following examples.

*me (sa) seni.*
– I am old.  
*me vola sa juni.*
– I want to be young.  
*ti buke (sa) boni.*
– Your book is good.

Stative verbs differ from other verbs by the fact that
a stative verb is about being in a state
whereas other verbs indicate a change of state.

Stative verbs are always intransitive.
They can't take an object.



## Participles

*-an-*
denotes someone or something that does the action of the root.
It is the active participle suffix.

*loga*
– to speak  
*logani*
– speaking  
*logane*
– the one who speaks

*-it-*
denotes someone or something that undergoes the action of the root.
It is the passive participle suffix.

*loga*
– to speak  
*logiti*
– spoken  
*padu*
– to fall  
*paditi*
– fallen  
*una*
to unite
→ *uniti*
united


### Causative verbs

The causatives are the verbs that are used to indicate
that one person causes another person to do something.
It can be by asking, paying, requesting, or forcing the person.

Sometimes the simple active verb is causative.

*Tomas pada Yusef.*
– Thomas drops Yusef.  
*Yusef padu.*
– Yusef falls.

In other situations, the causative is formed by using one of the participle suffixes.
*-ana* means that someone causes someone to do something.
*-ita* means that someone causes something to be done to someone or something.

*Sara padana Tomas.*
– Sara causes Thomas to drop (something).  
*Sara padita Yusef.*
– Sara causes Yusef to be dropped.

Here is a more complete example.
Note that "to feed" has two different causative meanings in English.

*pex yamu.*
– Fish is eaten.  
*mau yama pex.*
– The cat eats fish.  
*me yamita pex pa mau.*
– I feed fish to the cat.  
*me yamana mau va pex.*
– I feed the cat with fish.

A causative can imply that the action is done for the causer.

*me no bina dom. me binita le.*
– I don't build the house. I have it built (for myself).


## Prepositions

In Panlingue, prepositions are basically a sub-category of verbs.

### Prepositions of place and time

Panlingue has five prepositions of place and time.

1. *ya* - presence or togetherness:
   with, by use of
2. *na* - absence or lack: without
3. *va* - location or moment (in general):
   at, in, on, by
4. *ja* - origin, beginning or cause: from, since, because
5. *pa* - destination, end or purpose: to, till, until, for, then

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase
the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

*me va hotel.*
– I'm in the hotel.  
*me sona va hotel.*
– I sleep in the hotel.  
*me sona ja xam pa sube.*
– I sleep since evening until morning.  
*me safara ja London pa Paris.*
– I travel from London to Paris.  

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they
refer to time.

*me denga ja te kita.*
– I have waited since you left.  
*me denga pa te laya dom.*
– I wait until you come home.  
*me denga va te sona.*
– I wait while you sleep.  

#### va

*va* is an all-purpose locative preposition.
Its basic meaning is "at".
 
*me liba va dome.*  
_I stand with house._  
I stand by the house.
 
*me loga va panlingue.*  
_I speak with Panlingue._  
I speak in Panlingue.
 
*me loga ya doste va panlingue va fon.*  
_I speak with friends with Panlingue with telephone._  
I speak with friends in Panlingue by telephone.

#### Verbs as prepositions

In Panlingue some verbs function like prepositions do in English.

*me kata ban.*
– I cut bread.  
*me kata ban, uza chake.*
– I cut bread, use a knife. (I cut bread with a knife.)  

*me denga dura dul hor.* - I wait, (it) lasts two hours. (I wait during/for two hours.)

Here are some verbs that are usable as prepositions:

*bada* - to follow; after, behind  
*dura* - to last; during, for the time/duration of  
*jungu* - to be centered; amid, amidst, in the middle, in the center  
*loka* - to occupy, to be located; at  
*sirka* - to surround; around  
*supra* - to surpass; over, above  

#### Verbs without prepositions

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Panlingue as in English. In
many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

*me laya dome.*
– I come home.  
*te sida kurse.*
– You sit (on) the chair.  
*le lala sofa.*
– S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
*pex nata daria.*
– Fish swim (in) the sea.  
*jenger marca dau.*
– Warriors march (on) the road.  

### Preposition of relation

Preposition *ka* indicates the way something is done.
It corresponds to English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

*me sava panlingue ka master.*
– I know Panlingue like a master.

*ka*
relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison.
In the above example
*sava*
(know) is the verb and
*master*
(master) is the point of comparison.

*ka* is also used when adjectives are compared.

*pute sa min dayi ko pape.*
– The child is smaller than the father.  
*laupape sa samo dayi ka pape.*
– Grandfather is as big as father.

*ka* relates the adverbs of comparison
– *max* (more), *min* (less) and *samo* (same) –
to the point of comparison, which is *pape* (father) in the examples above.
