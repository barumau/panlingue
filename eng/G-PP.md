# Prepositions

In Panlingue, prepositions are basically a sub-category of verbs.

## Prepositions of place and time

Panlingue has five prepositions of place and time.

1. *ya* - presence or togetherness:
   with, by use of
2. *na* - absence or lack: without
3. *va* - location or moment (in general):
   at, in, on, by
4. *ja* - origin, beginning or cause: from, since, because
5. *pa* - destination, end or purpose: to, till, until, for, then

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase
the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

*me va hotel.*
– I'm in the hotel.  
*me sona va hotel.*
– I sleep in the hotel.  
*me sona ja xam pa sube.*
– I sleep since evening until morning.  
*me safara ja London pa Paris.*
– I travel from London to Paris.  

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they
refer to time.

*me denga ja te kita.*
– I have waited since you left.  
*me denga pa te laya dom.*
– I wait until you come home.  
*me denga va te sona.*
– I wait while you sleep.  

### va

*va* is an all-purpose locative preposition.
Its basic meaning is "at".
 
*me liba va dome.*  
_I stand with house._  
I stand by the house.
 
*me loga va panlingue.*  
_I speak with Panlingue._  
I speak in Panlingue.
 
*me loga ya doste va panlingue va fon.*  
_I speak with friends with Panlingue with telephone._  
I speak with friends in Panlingue by telephone.

### Verbs as prepositions

In Panlingue some verbs function like prepositions do in English.

*me kata ban.*
– I cut bread.  
*me kata ban, uza chake.*
– I cut bread, use a knife. (I cut bread with a knife.)  

*me denga dura dul hor.* - I wait, (it) lasts two hours. (I wait during/for two hours.)

Here are some verbs that are usable as prepositions:

*bada* - to follow; after, behind  
*dura* - to last; during, for the time/duration of  
*jungu* - to be centered; amid, amidst, in the middle, in the center  
*loka* - to occupy, to be located; at  
*sirka* - to surround; around  
*supra* - to surpass; over, above  

### Verbs without prepositions

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Panlingue as in English. In
many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

*me laya dome.*
– I come home.  
*te sida kurse.*
– You sit (on) the chair.  
*le lala sofa.*
– S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
*pex nata daria.*
– Fish swim (in) the sea.  
*jenger marca dau.*
– Warriors march (on) the road.  

## Preposition of relation

Preposition *ka* indicates the way something is done.
It corresponds to English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

*me sava panlingue ka master.*
– I know Panlingue like a master.

*ka*
relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison.
In the above example
*sava*
(know) is the verb and
*master*
(master) is the point of comparison.

*ka* is also used when adjectives are compared.

*pute sa min dayi ko pape.*
– The child is smaller than the father.  
*laupape sa samo dayi ka pape.*
– Grandfather is as big as father.

*ka* relates the adverbs of comparison
– *max* (more), *min* (less) and *samo* (same) –
to the point of comparison, which is *pape* (father) in the examples above.
