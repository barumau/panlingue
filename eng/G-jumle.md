## Building blocks for sentences

Sentences consist of clauses, which in turn consist of constituents,
which are phrases, which consist of words and have a certain internal word order.

The clause constituents are listed below.

- The subject is the topic of the sentence.
  It is typically a noun phrase.
- The predicate says something about the subject.
  In the narrow sense it covers only the verb and its modifiers,
  which indicate the event or action that is occuring.
- The object is the participant that is affected by the event.
- The predicative is a complement of the predicate that describes the subject.
- Adverbial indicates means or circumstances that are involved in the event.

| Subject | Predicate | Object | Adverbial |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| A young man | is driving | a car | on the street. |
| We | should take | our old stuff | to the flea market. |

| Subject | Predicate | Predicative | Adverbial |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| You  and me | are | happy | together. |
| My friend | got | upset | for the war. |

The clause constituents are phrases.
The main phrase types are listed below.

- The noun phrase (NP) consists of a determiner (det.), adjectives and a noun.
  The noun is the head of the noun phrase,
  which means that it is the main word
  and the other words only add to its meaning.
  The head can serve alone as the noun phrase whereas the other words can't.
- The adjective phrase (AP) consists of an adjective (adj.) with any adverbs (adv.) that modify it.
- The verb phrase (VP) consists of a tense, aspect or mood marker (TAM),
  one or more adverbs and a verb (or a verb series).
  The verb is the main word of the verb phrase.
- The preposition phrase consists of a preposition (prep.) as head
  and usually a noun phrase as its complement.

Panlingue sentences are made up of the building blocks listed above.
The figure below shows the decomposition of a Panlingue sentence
in three levels: (1) clause constituents, (2) phrases and (3) words.

		 'That young man walked fast on the big road.'

## Clause types

### Predicative clause

The basic predicative clause patterns are:  
Someone is something.  
Someone is of some kind of.  
In short, the subject is what the predicative says.

The predicative clause is simple in Panlingue.
What is new for English speakers, is that the copula verb ’to be’ can be left out.
It’s not necessary in Panlingue.
There are two types of predicative clause: verbal and nominal.

    Figure 2. Decomposition of the copula clause.
    
     ╔═════════╗   ╔═══════════╗      ╔═════════════╗
     ║ SUBJECT ║   ║  (COPULA) ║      ║ PREDICATIVE ║
     ╚════╤════╝   ╚═════╤═════╝      ╚══════╤══════╝
          │              │              ┌────┴───────┐
    ┌─────┴─────┐  ┌─────┴─────┐  ┌─────┴─────┐ ┌────┴──────┐
    │noun phrase│  │verb phrase│  │noun phrase│ │adj. phrase│
    └─────┬─────┘  └─────┬─────┘  └─────┬─────┘ └─────┬─────┘
          │              │              │             │
    ┌───┬─┴─┬────┐ ┌───┬─┴─┬────┐ ┌───┬─┴─┬────┐  ┌───┼───┐
    │det│adj│noun│ │TAM│adv│verb│ │det│adj│noun│  │adv│adj│
    └───┴───┴────┘ └───┴───┴────┘ └───┴───┴────┘  └───┴───┘


#### Nominal predicative clause

A predicative completes the meaning of a sentence by giving information about a noun by either renaming it or describing it.
Often there is no copula verb (i.e. linking verb) between the subject and its predicative complement.

**le Ali.**
– He is Ali.  
**Ali guru.**
– Ali is a teacher.  
**Ali riki.**
– Ali is rich.  
**Ali va dome.**
– Ali is at home.


#### Verbal predicative clause

The copula verb
**sa**
'to be'
can be used optionally in simple predicative sentences like the ones above.

**le sa Ali.**
– He is Ali.  
**Ali sa guru.**
– Ali is a teacher.  
**Ali sa riki.**
– Ali is rich.  
**Ali sa va dome.**
– Ali is at home.

The copula verb is used when it is necessary in order to convey the desired meaning.
For example, modal verbs, like
**vola**
'to want', always need it as the main verb
because the sentences would have a different meaning without it.

**le vola sa guru.**
– He (or she) wants to be a teacher.  
Compare with:  
**le vola guru.**
– He (or she) wants a teacher.

**le vola sa riki.**
– He (or she) wants to be rich.  
Compare with:  
**le vola riki.**
– He (or she) wants a rich one.

The linking verb is used also when structural complexity of subject and/or predicate
makes the boundary between the two sentence elements doubtful.

**mi kare meda bache.**
– My job helps children.  
**mi kare sa meda bache.**
–  My job is to help children.

It is also possible to use a pause,
that is indicated by a dash in writing,
instead of the linking verb.

**mi kare – meda bache.**
– My job: to help children.


#### Negating the complement

All predicative complements can be negated by
**no**
'not'
and the linking verb
**es**
is optional in the same cases as before

**le no Ali.** ~ **le no sa Ali.**
– He is not Ali.  
**le no guru.** ~ **le no sa guru.**
– He is not a teacher.  
**le no vola sa guru.**
– He doesn't want to be a teacher.  
**le no riki.** ~ **le no sa riki.**
– He is not rich.  
**le no vola sa riki.**
– He doesn't want to be rich.  
**le no va dome.** ~ **le no sa va dome.**
– He is not at home.  
**li kare no sa meda bache.**
– His job is not to help children.


#### Adjective and verb subjects

In addition to noun subjects and pronoun subjects,
the previous rules apply also to adjective subjects and verb subjects.

**juni – meyi.** ~ **juni sa meyi.**
– Young is beautiful.  
**juni – no seni.** ~ **juni no sa seni.**
– Young is not old.  
**gana – boni.** ~ **gana sa havi.**
– Singing is good.  
**gana – no dusi.** ~ **gana no sa dusi.**
– Singing is not bad.  
**skoliza bache – meda bache.** ~ **skoliza bache sa meda bache.**
– To teach children is to help children.



## Intransitive clause

The purpose of the intransitive clause is to express an event, where someone does something, or where something happens.
The intransitive clause contains only one participant, the subject.
It is the doer or the experiencer of the event.
Intransitive clause does not contain an object.

    Figure 3. Decomposition of the intransitive clause.
    
     ╔═════════╗   ╔═══════════╗
     ║ SUBJECT ║   ║ PREDICATE ║
     ╚════╤════╝   ╚═════╤═════╝
          │              │
    ┌─────┴─────┐  ┌─────┴─────┐
    │noun phrase│  │verb phrase│
    └─────┬─────┘  └─────┬─────┘
          │              │
    ┌───┬─┴─┬────┐ ┌───┬─┴─┬────┐
    │det│adj│noun│ │TAM│adv│verb│
    └───┴───┴────┘ └───┴───┴────┘

Here are some examples of intransitive clauses.
*Children run.* This sentence tells what the children do, they run.
*The door opens.* This sentence tells what the door does, it opens.
*The old man dies.* This sentence tells what the old man experiences, he dies.

The actions described by intransitive clauses can be voluntary or involuntary.
They are done by the subject, or they just happen to the subject.

In intransitive clauses, if anyone at all is affected by the event, it is the subject.
So the action is directed at the subject.
The subject undergoes a change.
The change can be a change of state or a change of place.

In the sentence *the children run*, the subject changes place.
In the sentence *the old man dies*, the subject changes state from living to dead.

Here are some intransitive clauses in Panlingue.
The subjects are written in cursive.

***bache*** **kursa.**
– Children run.  
***juni feme*** **dansa.**
– The young woman dances.  
***seni mane*** **mortu.**
– The old man died.

Note that Panlingue verbs don’t indicate tense by themselves.
So they can express the past and present alike.
Therefore for example **mortu** can mean both ’died’ and ’dies’.

So called intransitive verbs can take a cognate object, whose meaning is very close to the meaning of the verb.
For example the sentence **bache kursa**, 'the children run', can take an object like **longi kurse**, 'a long run'.

***Bache** **kursa longi kurse.**
– 'The chilren run a long run.'

The meaning of the sentence doesn’t really change.
It is still about an activity and a change of place,
but structurally it is now a transitive clause.

***juni feme*** **dansa meyi danse.**
– The young woman dances a beautiful dance.  
***seni mane*** **mortu havi morte.**
– The old man died a good death.


## Transitive clause

The transitive clause is the most versatile clause type in Panlingue, and it has many different realizations.

Transitive clauses are clauses where the verb takes a direct object.
The purpose of the transitive clause is to express an event where someone does something to someone or something.

The three constituents of the transitive clause are subject, verb and object.
In theory, they can be ordered in many different ways.
In Panlingue, their normal order is subject–verb–object (SVO).
This order is one of the most common word orders among world's languages.
It is the most common word order by number of speakers
and the second-most common order by number of languages.

    Figure 4. Decomposition of the transitive clause.
    
     ╔═════════╗   ╔═══════════╗   ╔════════╗
     ║ SUBJECT ║   ║ PREDICATE ║   ║ OBJECT ║
     ╚════╤════╝   ╚═════╤═════╝   ╚════╤═══╝
          │              │              │
    ┌─────┴─────┐  ┌─────┴─────┐  ┌─────┴─────┐
    │noun phrase│  │verb phrase│  │noun phrase│
    └─────┬─────┘  └─────┬─────┘  └─────┬─────┘
          │              │              │
    ┌───┬─┴─┬────┐ ┌───┬─┴─┬────┐ ┌───┬─┴─┬────┐
    │det│adj│noun│ │TAM│adv│verb│ │det│adj│noun│
    └───┴───┴────┘ └───┴───┴────┘ └───┴───┴────┘
     li  juni mane  levo    vida   un  seni guru.
    'The young man  did     see    an  old guru.'

Transitive clauses are called transitive because they express an event where some energy transits from the subject to the object.
Subject–verb–object is a natural word order,
because it follows the natural order of the event.
The subject is the source of the energy
and it sends the energy through the verb, which transits it to the object.
The object receives the energy and is affected by it.

In transitive clauses, the subject is the agent and the object is the patient.
There is a lot of variation in the the roles of agent and patient,
but their most basic types can be described as prototypical roles.

The prototypical agent

1. is alive
2. can move
3. participates in the event by its own will
4. causes a change in another participant
5. exists independently of the event.

The prototypical patient

1. might be a non-living thing
2. is standing still relative to another participant
3. is drawn into the event by another participant
4. undergoes a change because of the event
5. might not exist without the event.

In the event, energy flows from the agent to the patient
in the form that the verb describes.
Consider the following sentence,
where the child is the agent that departs energy in the form of a push to the ball, the patient.

**bache dapa bole.**
– The child hits the ball.

There can also be an instrument that mediates the flow of energy from the agent to the patient.
The sequence `agent > instrument > patient` reflects the flow of energy in an action chain.

**bache uza bange dapa bole.**
– The child uses the bat to hit the ball.

The order of the participants is in line with the order of the action chain in reality.
The agent, as the origin of the energy flow, is in the beginning,
the instrument is in the middle,
and the patient, as the recipient of the energy flow, is in the end.

In syntactical terms the order of the words is subject–verb–object (or SVO in short).
This is the normal and neutral word order in Panlingue.

For example, in the following sentence, the subject is
**me**
'I',
the verb is
**vida**
'see',
and the object is
**te**
'you'.

**me vida te.**
– I see you.

If the words are arranged in the opposite order, the entire sentence will have an opposite meaning.

**te vida me.**
– You see me.

The subject and object roles are related to syntax, which deals with word order and other grammatical phenomena.
The agent, instrument and patient roles are related to semantics, which is about the meaning of words.
The semantic and syntactic roles can be mapped together in many ways.
Usually the most energetic semantic participant takes the role of the subject.

1. If there is an agent, it becomes the subject.
    - ***bache* uza bange dapa bole.**
      – *The child* uses the bat to hit the ball.  
2. Otherwise, if there is an instrument, it becomes the subject.
    - ***bange* dapa bole.**
      – *The bat* hits the ball.  
3. Otherwise the patient becomes the subject and the clause type becomes intransitive.
    - ***bole* dapu.**
      – *The ball* is hit.



## Observations

Observations are the simplest sentence type.
They may consist of only one word, which draws the listener's attention.

**mau!**
– A cat!  
**barxa!**
– (It) rains!

## Stative Sentences

### With noun or pronoun subject

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate.
In the simplest sentences, the subject is a noun or a pronoun and the predicate is an adjective or a noun.

**me boni.**
– I am good.  
**le novi.**
– It is new.  
**le Sara.**
– She is Sara.  
**Sara boni.**
– Sara is good.  
**petre dayi.**
– The stone is big.  
**meze novi.**
– The table is new.  

The word **no** is added to form the negative.

**me no boni.**
– I'm not good.  
**le no novi.**
– It's not new.  
**le no Sara.**
– She is not Sara.

It is possible to add the word **sa** (to be) before the predicate in positive sentences,
for style or for convenience.
Then the structure is similar like in negative sentences.

**Sara sa boni.**
– Sara is good.  
**petre sa dayi.**
– The stone is big.  
**meze sa novi.**
– The table is new.  
**meze no purani.**
– The table is not old.

Also two personal pronouns can be combined with **si** and **no**.

**me sa le.**
– I am he/she.  
**me no sa te.**
– I'm not you.

### With adjective subject

The same rule applies also for two adjectives.

**jovani sa sundari.**
– Young is beautiful.  
**novi no sa purani.**
– New is not old.  

### With verb subject

A verb can't be subject as such.
So the verb is first, use **de** to start a comment about the verb.

**canta, de sa boni.**
– Singing, that is good. (Singing is good.)


## Active Sentences

An active sentence is a sentence where the subject does the action denoted by the verb to the object.
The focus is on the subject as the active participant.
The correct word order is subject-verb-object (SVO).

In Panlingue, active verbs are easy to identify because all of them end in **-a**.


The following sentences are in SVO order.

**me yama aple.**
– I eat apples.  
**me vida te.**
– I see you.


## Passive Sentences

In the passive voice the focus of the sentence is on a subject
that is a passive recipient that undergoes the action.
So the recipient is the subject of the sentence.
Often the agent is not mentioned at all.

In Panlingue, the passive voice is expressed with the verb ending in **-u**.
The word order is subject–verb–(optional object) or, more precisely,
recipient–verb–(optional agent).

**te vidu.**
– You are seen.  
**musike audu.**
– Music is heard.  
**pang beku.**
– Bread is baked.  
**kope parcu.**
– Cup breaks. (Cup gets broken.)

The agent can be mentioned after the verb with or without the preposition **da**.

**te vidu me.** - You are seen by me.  
**te vidu da me.** - You are seen by me.

Sometimes a passive verb can be translated with an active verb in English.
That is sometimes the case with **suku**, which means _to be pleased by_ (a passive verb) or _to like_ (an active verb).
That is because the direction of pleasing is from the active doer to the passive recipient.

**me suku musike.**
– I am pleased by music. / I like music.


### Pivot construction

#### Basic pivot construction

The **basic pivot construction** is a syntactic realization of an action chain
that reflects the flow of energy from one participant to another.
A basic sequence is that of `agent > instrument > patient`.

**da uze un chaku kate la ban.**
– He uses a knife to cut the bread.  
**da jete la bol dape la dike.**
– He throws the ball to hit the target.  
**mi shofe la char lai la site.**
– He drives the car to enter the city.

Another common sequence is that of `causer > agent > patient`.
In such sequences the first verb typically indicates a modality such as desire, permission or obligation,
and the second verb indicates what the causer wants the agent to do.

**mi vol tu yam fite.**
– I want you to eat vegetables. (desire)  
**mi sel tu yam fite.**
– I advise you to eat vegetables. (advice)  
**mi halal tu yam fite.**
– I allow you to eat vegetables. (permission)  
**mi bil tu yam fite.**
– I enable you to eat vegetables. (ability)  
**mi mus tu yam fite.**
– I compel you to eat vegetables. (obligation)  
**mi rai tu yam fite.**
– I think you eat vegetables. (opinion)

Syntactically the pivot construction is made up of
`subject–verb₁–pivot–verb₂–object`.
The pivot is at the same time the object for verb₁ and the subject for the verb₂.

**mi vol tu yam yo fite.**
– I want you to eat vegetables.

In the example above,
**mi vol**
has
**tu**
as its object.
At the same time, the very same
**tu**
functions as the subject of the following predicate,
**yam yo fite**.
So
**tu**
is the pivot that links the clauses together.

A complete action chain is that of `causer > agent > instrument > patient > recipient`.
The previous sequences, `agent > instrument > patient` and `causer > agent > patient`, were in fact only subsequences of this chain.
One may pick any or all participants of the action chain into a sentence
as long as they stay in the same order.
In the following example sentence all optional participants and their verbs are enclosed in brackets.

**(mi vol) (tu uze) (la chaku) kate la ban (don ma).**
– I want you to use the knife to cut the bread and give to mother.


#### Modal pivot construction

In pivot constructions where the first action indicates a modality, such as desire, permission or obligation,
the first participant can be left out when it indicates the first person ('I').
The the remaining syntactic construction is `verb₁–pivot–verb₂–object`.

**me suala te laya dome.**
– I ask (whether) you come come?  
**suala te laya dome.**
– Do you come come?

**me asha te yama maxi fite.**
– I wish you would eat more vegetables.  
**asha te yama maxi fite.**
– Wish you would eat more vegetables.

In commands and requests also the second participant can be left out
when it indicates the second person ('you').
The the remaining syntactic structure is `verb₁–verb₂–object`.

**me chinga te laya dome.**
– I ask you to come home.  
**chinga laya dome!**
– Please come home!  
**me amra te kluza mune.**
– I command you to shut the door.  
**amra kluza mune.**
– Shut the door!


### Serial verb construction

People tend to express actions that they want to or should do differently than actions that they want other people to do.
They don't say, for example, *I want that I write* but they say *I want to write*.
Looks like it is worthwhile to mention the participants only when they add new information to the sentence.
The second participant can be left out from the pivot construction when it is the same as the subject.

***me*** **vola** ***me*** **kitaba letre.**
– *I* want *me* to write a letter.  
***me*** **vola kitaba letre.**
– I want to write a letter.

This structure is called the verb series or the serial verb construction.
It is very common in Panlingue.
There can be two, three or even more verbs in a series.
All verbs are about the same subject.
 
1. **me laya dome.**
   – I come home.  
2. **me bila laya dome.**
   – I can come home.  
3. **me vola bila laya dome.**
   – I want to be able to come home.
   (Word for word: _I want can come home_!)

The last verb in the series is the main verb.
The verbs before it are modal verbs
that indicate a modality such as likelihood, ability, advice, permission, desire, or obligation.

**te vola yama fite.**
– You want to eat vegetables. (desire)  
**te selu yama fite.**
– You had better eat vegetables. (advice)  
**te halalu yama fite.**
– You may eat vegetables. (permission)  
**te bila yama fite.**
– You can eat vegetables. (ability)  
**te musu yama fite.**
– You must eat vegetables. (obligation)


## Changing the focus

The **topic** is what is being talked about,
and the **comment** is what is being said about the topic.
Typically the topic is something that is known before and the comment is a piece of new information about the topic.
In Panlingue the topic comes first so it is a topic-fronting language.

The focus of the sentence can be changed by changing the order of the topic and comment.

**Maria sa guru.**
– Maria is a teacher.  
**guru sa Maria.**
– The teacher is Maria.

In Panlingue, the topic can be fronted by using various sentence structures,
such as passivization and change of word order.
Consider the following sentence:

**me vida te.**
– I see you.

The topic of the sentence is the subject
**me**
'I'.
The object,
**te**,
can be topicalized by moving it to the front.
There are several ways how to do it.
The simplest one involves a simple change of word order.

**te me vida.**
– (It's) you I saw.

One can also use the passive construction to a similar effect.

**te beyu me vida.**
– You were seen by me.

Another way to front the object is to use the relative clause construction.

**te sa de me vida.**
– You are the one whom I saw.

This sentence can be made more impactful by fronting the linking verb
**sa**.
and then even more by dropping the relative pronoun.

**sa te de me vida.**
– It's you whom I saw.  
**sa te me vida.**
– It's you I saw.

Finally, the same
**sa...**
constructions can be used for emphasizing the topicness of the normal subject too.

**sa me de vida te.** ~ **sa me vida te.**
– It's me who saw you.  
**sa me de laya.** ~ **sa me laya.**
– It's me who came.


## Relative clauses

A relative clause is a subordinate clause that modifies a noun phrase, most commonly a noun.
For example, the phrase "the person who lives there" containst the noun _person_,
which is modified by the relative clause _who lives there_.

There are different ways to build a relative clause in Panlingue.
The relative pronoun in Panlingue is **de**
and it corresponds to English _that_, _who_ and _which_.

The relativized word can be emphasized by **di**,
as in the following example,
but it is necessary only in complex phrases.

In Panlingue, relative clauses are always set off by commas.

**di buke, de jan kitaba, padu.**
– _That_ book, which the person writes, falls.

Normally the same sentence includes only **de**.

**buke, de jan kitaba, padu.**
– The book that the person writes falls.

It is possible to leave also **de** out.
This structure is called _reduced relative clause_.

**buke, jan kitaba, padu.**
– The book the person writes falls.

The relative pronoun is necessary
when the relativized noun is the subject of the relative clause.

**jan, de kitaba buke, padu.**
– The person that writes the book falls.

Also the object noun of a preposition can be the target of the relative clause.
It's possible to use relative pronouns or the reduced relative clause structure.

**_di_ kalam, ya _de_ jan kitaba buke, padu.**
– _That_ pen, with _which_ the person writes the book, falls.  
**kalam, jan kitaba buke ya, padu.**
– The pen the person writes the book with falls.

The relative pronoun can be put in its right place in the pivot structure
or it can be left out by using the reduced relative clause structure.

**_di_ jan, me vida _de_ kitaba buke, padu.**
– The person, whom I see write the book, falls.  
**jan, me vida kitaba buke, padu.**
– The person that I see write the book falls.  

Also _resumptive relative pronoun_ can be used if needed.

**_di_ jan, me kitaba buke ya _de_ du kalam, padu.**
– The person whose pen I write the book with falls.  

Finally, a content clause can also involve **de**,
which refers back to the previous phrase.

**jan kitaba buke, de sa hami.**
– The person writes a book, which is important.

However, it is unclear whethere **de** (_which_) refers to only the book
or the fact that the person writes the book.
It can be clarified by an expression like
**di fate**
(_the fact_).

**jan kitaba buke, di fate sa hami.**
– The fact that the person writes the book is important.

## Particles

### Affirmation and Negation

#### Affirmative

Expressions are affirmative by default.

**me sa xef.**
– I am the boss.  
**le sa novi meze.**
– It is a new table.

Affirmation can be emphasized with the adverb
**yo**
(_indeed_).

**me yo sa xef.**
– I indeed am the boss.  
**le yo sa novi meze.**
– It indeed is a new table.

#### Negative

Such sentences can be simply negated with **no**.

**le no sa xef.**
– He is not the boss.  
**le no sa novi meze.**
– It's not a new table.

The word **no** is used for denying anything.
It affects always the next word.
Different scopes of negation may result depending on the location of the negative word.

**me vida te.**
– I see you.  
**me no vida te.**
– I don't see you.  
**me vida no te a lole.**
– I see, not you, but them.

**me cinga te safa kamre.**
– I ask you to clean the room.  
**me no cinga te safa kamre.**
– I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
**me cinga te no safa kamre.**
– I ask you NOT to clean the room.

Words
**ye**
(_yes_) and
**no**
(_no_) are used for answering questions.

**suala te vida me?**
– Do you see me?  
**ye. (me yo vida te.)**
– Yes. (I indeed see you.)  
**no. (me no vida te.)**
– No. (I don't see you.)

Negative questions are answered so that
**ye**
and
**no**
apply to the verb, not the whole question.

**suala te no vida me?**
– Don't you see me?  
**ye. (me vida te.)**
– Yes. (I see you.)  
**no. (me no vida te.)**
– No. (I don't see you.)


### Modifier particles

Particles **du** and **da** are used to link a noun, an adjective or a verb phrase to a noun to modify it.
**du** connects the modifying word or phrase to the main noun word.
**da** works in the opposite direction, it connects the main noun to the modifying word or phrase.

#### Possession

The modifier particle can be used for any possessive noun or pronoun.

With regards to possession, **du** works like the apostrophe-s ('s) in English.
It indicates that the previous word has possession of the next one.

**Maria du mam**
– Maria's mother  
**Maria du mam du dom**
– Maria's mother's house

**da** works like "of" in English.
It indicates that the next word has possession of the previous one.

**mam da Maria**
– the mother of Maria  
**dom da mam da Maria**
– the house of the mother of Maria

It's possible to use **da** and **du** with personal pronouns too,
so one can say things like
**dom da me** (_the house of mine_)
but it's better to use the short possessive pronouns and say simply
**mi dom** (_my house_).

#### Modification with noun phrases

Another way to use these particles is to connect an adjective or other words with a noun.
It gives us more information about the noun, and the particle makes it clear in which end the main noun is.

The modifier particles are useful for creating complex adjectives that consists of two or more words.

**rozi rang du labe**
– rose-colored lips  
**samani rang du oke**
– sky-colored eyes

Or in the opposite order:

**labe da rozi rang**
– lips of the rose-color  
**oke da samani rang**
– eyes of the sky-color

The particles help in creating measure words too.

**un sake du patate**
– one sack of potatoes  
**dui sake du patate**
– two sacks of potatoes  
**maxi sake du patate**
– more sacks of potatoes

Note that **du** and **da** connect phrases together.
So a modifier phrase with and without **du** can mean a different thing.

**maxo meyi fule**
– more beautiful flowers  
**maxi meyi fule**
– more (of) beautiful flowers

#### Modification with verb phrases

Verbs and verb phrases are turned into modifiers by placing **da** or **du** immediately next to the verb.

**arte da penta grafe**
– the art of painting pictures  
**suke da meda ale**
– the joy of helping others
